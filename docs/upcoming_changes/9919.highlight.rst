Support for NumPy 2.2
=====================

Numba now supports NumPy 2.2. following are some notable changes:

- ``np.empty(0)`` cannot be treated as a boolean value anymore. This is a
  breaking change for code that relies on this behavior. The following code
  will raise a ``ValueError``:

  .. code-block:: python

      import numpy as np
      if np.empty(0):
          print("This will not be printed")

- Generic timedeltas can no longer be hashed due to undefined time units.

- ``np.trimzeros`` now also trims ``\0`` values.
